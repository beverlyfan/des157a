            <h2>Journal 1 — Research Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-10-16">October 16, 2023</time>
            <p>According to the article <i><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a></i> by Salim Ansari, a form's UX can greatly affect how efficiently or thoroughly a user is “converted”. Problems with how usable a form is can influence whether or not a user decides to complete and submit a form, or abandon it altogether. Some of these issues may include the form being too long, consisting of too much cognitive load, or even something simple like size of input fields. Many of the tips listed in this article were ones that I was previously aware of, such as the indication of a progress bar or a password unmaking option. I think that while these may seem like subtle changes to the UX of a form, it has a very large impact on how usable the form by making it easier for the user to complete, and have an incentive to keep going even if the form is longer. There were other tips listed in the article that I had not noticed as important prior to reading the article. An example is how the usage of inline labels is a drawback, especially for users who use the tab button to go to the next field. As someone who uses the tab button when filling out a form, I had not realized that this habit was something that UX designers took note of when designing forms. I found this very interesting and insightful, and encourages me to also think about my own form-filling habits when designing my own forms. Another tip that I did not take much notice of until reading this article was about sizing the input fields according to what information is asked. Since I am someone who likes to design with symmetry to create a feeling of organization, I did not realize how helpful it would be to users to make the input fields formatted around the expected amount of text. I think this is definitely a key point, because when I think back on previous forms that I have filled out, I have also noticed input fields such as phone number or zip code being designed as boxes that tell the user the exact number of values they need to input. Overall, I think these tips are all important when it comes to designing a form and can definitely make any form's usability greatly improved if implemented.</p>
            <p>One website form that I think works well is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon's</a> checkout site. Firstly, the checkout button is clearly visible due to its color, and all the required fields are sectioned with hierarchy so it is clear to the user prior to filling out the form what information they would need to provide. Sensitive information is also labeled with a reasoning as to why it is required to fill out, and the form's use of input field spacing and dropdown lists is intuitive.</p>
