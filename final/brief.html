            <h2><strong>Project Brief</strong></h2>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>The project I am updating for my final project is the Every Picture project. I plan to focus on improving the visual design and UX/UI aspect of this project.</p>
            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>To target improvement on my project's visual design, I first plan on incorporating more images into my notebook. One way I would do this is by giving the notebook a background image, such as a wood pattern to make it appear as if the notebook is sitting on a desk. When the user hovers over different stamps, I would like to make the background image transition into a picture from each respective park. If I have the time, I would also like to include a "magnifying glass" feature that allows users to hover over the stamp to enlarge details. Another area of my project I plan to update is the UX/UI. I want to do this by making the website a little more usable. One thing that I received feedback on was allowing users to exit the dialog window by simply clicking out of it, instead of only being able to click on the "X". In a similar vein, I will also move the placement of the dialog exit button to the right side instead of the left.</p>
            <h3>Expert Feedback</h3>
            <p>The people I plan to get feedback from are designers. One person I would discuss my project feedback with is our undergrad design tutor, because they have experience with coding and can give me feedback that I would actually have the knowledge to attempt, based on what we have learned in the class. Another designer I could get feedback from is a back-end UX developer that I am friends with. Because they have experience in the design industry and have more knowledge about helpful UX techniques, I think their feedback would also be valuable for my project.</p>
