        <p>I visited Arches during the summer of 2016! It was a short hike Delicate Arch, which is the famed natural feature pictured in the background of the stamp. Some cool animals I spotted include mule deer, coyotes, desert cottontails, and jackrabbits!</p>

        <p>I visited Grand Canyon during the summer of 2016, and have visited this park about three times in total. I went camping here for the first time with my family, and got to see many viewpoints as well as animals.</p>

        <p>Denali National Park, which features the tallest mountain in North America Mount Denali, was the most recent National Park I visited this past summer. It is located in Alaska, and I got to see many cool animals such as caribou, brown bears, and moose. I also took a boat tour and got to see orcas, a humpback whale, bald eagles, seals, and sea lions! As pictured in the stamp, I was also able to visit the sled dogs that are well known for their role in the Iditarod.</p>

        <img src="images/yellowstone.png" alt="yellowstone" width="468" height="300">
        <p>I visited Yellowstone National Park during the summer of 2017. The most memorable features here were the geysers, such as Old Faithful pictured in the stamp. I was able to see many animals such as elk, moose, bears, mountain goats and of course, bison!</p>

        <p>I passed through Dixie National Forest during the summer of 2014, between the drive from Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park. I went again in the summer of 2016, on the way to Arches and Grand Canyon National Park. This was one of the first memorable hikes I remember because of the red rock canyons.</p>
